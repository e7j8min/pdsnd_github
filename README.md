### Description
Using the document template "Git Commands Documentation," fill in the appropriate responses and submit.

There are five sections in this document template. 
Each section includes a table with the instructions for you to complete in your local and remote repository and space to copy and paste the git commands. 
Once you complete each task, you will be required to include or copy and paste the git command in that corresponding table row.

Once you have completed entering the required responses within the tables in all four sections in this document, 
download this document as a PDF file. Please submit the PDF file of the Git Commands Documentation on the Project Submission page within the Udacity Classroom. 
There is also a place to add the url for your public GitHub repository in the first box. Add this link to the PDF, as your project will also be reviewed.
